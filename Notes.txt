Upcoming: Display Updating

Strategy for display updates:
-Read bytes for xoring from memory, zipWith some kind of test bit function to get a list of bools for updating starting at pos x,y
-Save result in list as a record in c8
-IO section will read list, make updates from that cycle to mutable IO array representing pixels, update VF on collision (c8 updated with VF status and injected into next cycle)
